# eCommerce-App for PLT

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Overview

The objective was to build a basic eCommerce web-based application (using React) that integrates the product and menu data from this DB:

There are a few basic shopping requirements. A user should be able to:

• View a list of products, with their price/info
• Add products to a basket
• Navigate to a basket screen
• Edit quantity/remove items from the basket screen

Careful consideration should be put into data fetching, state management, static typing and testing. Use of Redux and hooks for state storager and tranfer was utilised.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
